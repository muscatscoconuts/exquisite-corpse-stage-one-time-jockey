## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*When i thought about time i thought of old film reels showing a galloping horse in motion, and as well as seeing the passage of time through destruction and degradation so i decided to combine the two. i kind of went for a 'crazy doomsday timer' aesthetic, and allowed the viewer to 'begin time' through their own interaction with the program. I used a combination of fund images from google for the horses, and photos of photos in a magazine i found on my computer of a collapsing building, and then set up a seconds counter for the doomsday vibe. i was aiming for the feeling of running through time lightheartedly despite the decay of the world as time passes on. The extra still image was kind of a happy accident, but it made the sketch look more strange, so I kept it that way. The user is able to start time (the horses), but does this with the backdrop of another time cycle - there are some things we can control, and somethings that are far beyond it. *
